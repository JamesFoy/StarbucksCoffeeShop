This is a First Person VR Simulator with somewhat more natural 
controls. Both hands are fixed in front of your virtual body. 
To move your hand, move your whole body, similar to how grabbing
and movement is done in 3D shooters. 



Use [Ctrl] to toggle crouching.
Use [TAB] to switch between using the left, right or both hands.
Use [Left Mouse] to grab.
Use [Right Mouse] to trigger.
Use [Scroll Wheel] to move your active hands forward or backward.
